# SQL_practice_exercises

This repository contains my solutions to SQL questions solved on [sql-practice.com](https://www.sql-practice.com). The queries provided here demonstrate the skills I've developed in extracting, filtering, aggregating, and analyzing data across multiple tables.

## Database Schema Overview

I queried data from the following four tables:

### 1. **patients**
- `patient_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `gender`, `birth_date`, `height`, `weight`, `allergies`, `province_id`, `city`

### 2. **doctors**
- `doctor_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `specialty`

### 3. **admissions**
- `patient_id`, `admission_date`, `discharge_date`, `diagnosis`, `attending_doctor_id`

### 4. **province_names**
- `province_id`, `province_name`

## Topics and SQL Concepts Covered

These queries demonstrate my SQL proficiency in:

- **Basic data retrieval** (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`)
- **Conditional logic** (`CASE`, handling `NULL` values)
- **Data aggregation** (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`)
- **Table relationships** (`INNER JOIN`, joining multiple tables)
- **String manipulation** (`CONCAT`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`)
- **Date and time functions** (`YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`)
- **Window functions** (`LAG()`, `OVER()`)
- **Filtering with complex conditions** (`AND`, `OR`, `IN`, nested queries)
- **Custom sorting** (`ORDER BY`, conditional ordering with `CASE`)

## Sample Questions Solved

Here are some examples of questions I've answered, categorized by difficulty:

### ðŸ”¹ Easy
- Show first and last names of patients without allergies (`NULL` values).
- Update patient allergies from `NULL` to `'NKA'`.

### ðŸ”¸ Medium
- Find the patient with the greatest height.
- List patients admitted multiple times for the same diagnosis.
- Count patients per city and province.
- Display patient names in various custom formats.

### ðŸ”º Hard
- Calculate the percentage of male patients.
- Determine obesity status (`boolean`) using BMI calculations.
- Generate temporary passwords using patient-specific data.
- Analyze daily admissions with changes from the previous day (`LAG()`).
